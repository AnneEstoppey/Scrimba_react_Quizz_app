#### Introduction
In this project we elaborated the app with chatGPT (both 3.5 and 4, as a plus user on openai). The aim was to learn using chatGPT as an assistant for coding. 
Also we had the design of app in Figma, which of course helps a lot to start with (link to my Figma [here](https://www.figma.com/file/DdAGVzWAsASpXk1pj2fhRm/Quizzical-App-(Copy)?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=h8hPHnzgke6cfX4t-1)).
